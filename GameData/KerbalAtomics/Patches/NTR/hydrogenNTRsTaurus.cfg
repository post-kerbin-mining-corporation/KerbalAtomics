// MM Configs for changing various NTRs to use LqdHydrogen

// Taurus Nuke
// This part has two engine modules: one for the big nuclear engine, and one for
// the four small radial nozzles that may be either nuclear or chemical
// (depending on other patches).  The big nuclear engine is handled well enough
// by the LH2NTRsDynamic patch, and if the small radial nozzles are configured
// as nuclear, it handles those well enough too.  But if the radial nozzles are
// configured as chemical, the LH2NTRsDynamic patch doesn't touch them, so they
// still burn LF while the nuclear engine uses LH2.  This patch changes the
// chemical radial nozzles to burn LH2 instead, so the spacecraft doesn't have
// to carry both kinds of fuel.

	// look similar to the stock 24-77 "Twitch" engine (0.09 tons) but are
	// roughly twice as big, so 0.8 tons of the part's mass should be excluded
	// from the 0.75x NTR mass adjustment.
