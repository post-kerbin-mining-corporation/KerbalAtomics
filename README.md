## Features

This mod features several new nuclear thermal engines that expand the range of nuclear propulsion options available. All these engines use a new resource, Liquid Hydrogen. Engines are provided in almost all size classes  

* **Bimodal Engines:** Can switch to using both LH2 and Oxidizer for a thrust boost at the cost of efficiency. Available in a 1.25m size.
* **Trimodal Engines:** Like a bimodal engine, but also generates a nice amount of energy when idle. In 0.625m, 1.25m and 2.5m sizes.
* **Gas Core Engines:** Advanced nuclear designs in closed-cyle and open-cycle versions. The open-cycle engine is horrifically overpowered, but cannot be refueled.
* **Nuclear Aerospikes:** For launch operations, a solid core and a gas core aerospike. Compromises, much like the regular stock aerospike

In addition, my CryoTanks mod is also bundled to provide fuel handling for Liquid Hydrogen.

* **Fuel Switching:** A set of patches provide fuel-switching features for most basic LF and LF/O tanks
* **Orbital Fuel Tanks:** A set of fuel tanks specially designed to contain LH2

For more information, check out the [CryoTanks readme](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CryoTanks/blob/master/README.md).

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Optional Patches

Some extra patches are bundled that you can use to tweak your installation. To install them, drop the correct folder from the **Extras** folder into your KSP GameData Folder

* **KerbalAtomicsNTRModSupport**: Supports other NTR mods by converting their NTRs to use LiquidHydrogen
* **KerbalAtomicsNTRsUseLF**: Converts engines to use LF instead of LH2 at the cost of a big chunk of Isp

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
