=====================
KERBAL ATOMICS v1.3.4
=====================

This pack aims to add more options to nuclear thermal propulsion systems in KSP. It adds several engines and modifies the stock nuclear engine to run on Liquid Hydrogen as an additional mode.
Liquid Hydrogen is a messy fuel that leaks out of most tanks (slowly) and takes up a lot of space, but gives the highest possible specific impulse. Included are patches that allow all stock fuel tanks to contain the appropriate resources, and a set of new specialized LiquidHydrogen tanks that are insulated to stop leakage.

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- B9PartSwitch (2.20.0)
- Community Resource Pack (1.4.2)
- ModuleManager (4.2.3)
- Deployable Engines (1.3.1)
- DynamicBatteryStorage (2.3.0)
- CryoTanks (1.6.6)


Optional
- Community Tech Tree (v3.0+)

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Kerbal Atomics before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place engines in various high tech nodes.

======================
